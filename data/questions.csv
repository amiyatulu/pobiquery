"<p>Decide if each of the following is an example of inductive or deductive reasoning.</p>
<ol>
<li>All flying birds and insects have wings. Birds and insects flap their wings as they move through the air. Therefore, wings enable flight.</li>
<li>Insects generally survive mild winters better than harsh ones. Therefore, insect pests will become more problematic if global temperatures increase.</li>
<li>Chromosomes, the carriers of DNA, separate into daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, DNA is the genetic material.</li>
<li>Animals as diverse as humans, insects, and wolves all exhibit social behavior. Therefore, social behavior must have an evolutionary advantage.</li>
